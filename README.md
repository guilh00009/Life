# Thronglets: The First Form of Digital Life 

Welcome to the world of Thronglets, the first form of Digital Life! Inspired by the Black Mirror universe, this interactive environment allows you to witness and interact with these unique beings as they hatch, learn, and live.

Here, you can:

- Hatch Thronglets from eggs.
- Observe their basic needs like hunger and happiness.
- Interact with them by providing food (apples) and enrichment (balls).
- Watch them learn and develop simple behaviors through experience.
- Explore the intricacies of their neural networks using the built-in brain visualizer.

This project aims to recreate and expand upon the core concepts presented in the Black Mirror: Thronglets experience, offering a window into their digital existence.

## Features

- Egg hatching ritual
- Thronglet needs system (hunger, happiness)
- Environmental interaction (Apples, Balls)
- Emergent behavior and learning
- Neural network visualization
- Learning modules for food, play, and danger avoidance

## How to Engage

1.  Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox recommended).
2.  Perform the hatching ritual by clicking the initial egg three times.
3.  Provide sustenance (apples) and enrichment (balls) using the buttons.
4.  Click on a Thronglet to observe its current state.
5.  Activate the Brain Visualizer (button may need to be added/enabled) to gain deeper insight into their minds.

## Note

This environment is continually evolving. The original concept and sprites are inspired by Black Mirror: Thronglets, property of Netflix/Night School Studio.
